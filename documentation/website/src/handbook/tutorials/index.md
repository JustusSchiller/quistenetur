# Serenity/JS Tutorials

The Serenity/JS tutorials will help you to better understand the motivation behind the framework and apply the
Screenplay Pattern in practice to automate acceptance tests interacting with an Angular web app.

You'll learn how integrate the Serenity/JS with Cucumber.js and Protractor and use it
to generate comprehensive test execution reports.

The Serenity/JS are a series of articles, in which you'll learn:
- why [speaking the right language](/handbook/tutorials/speaking-the-right-language.html) is important and why Page Objects are not the answer to a test script spaghetti,
- why capturing the business language and [writing what you'd like to read](handbook/tutorials/writing-what-you-would-like-to-read.html) can make an automated test easier to maintain,
- and what to do to [make the tests speak for themselves](/handbook/tutorials/making-the-tests-speak-for-themselves.html) and communicate the state of your application better to both technical and non-technical members of your team.
