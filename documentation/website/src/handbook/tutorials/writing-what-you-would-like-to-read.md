# Writing what you'd like to read

In the [previous article](/handbook/tutorials/speaking-the-right-language.html) we looked at how taking [the scripting approach](/handbook/tutorials/speaking-the-right-language.html#a-test-script) to test automation can result in a code base that's brittle and difficult to maintain.
We've also seen how [the Page Object(s) pattern](/handbook/tutorials/speaking-the-right-language.html#the-page-object-s-pattern) succeeded in addressing some of those problems, but also introduced some new ones.

In this article we'll look at how Serenity/JS and the [Screenplay Pattern](/handbook/design-guide/screenplay-pattern.html) can help us design test suites that are easier to extend, maintain and scale to meet the requirements of a modern business.
